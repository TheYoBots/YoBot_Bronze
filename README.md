# YoBot Bronze

My attempt at creating a [UCI](http://wbec-ridderkerk.nl/html/UCIProtocol.html) Chess Engine in python using [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess).

---
**Current State of Engine**

Currently only captures the piece with the highest value and detects a mate in one. Otherwise it simply generating random moves using [python-chess 1.5.0](https://pypi.org/project/chess/).
